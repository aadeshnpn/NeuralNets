NeuralNets
==========

Different types of Neural Nets Implementation

1. Simple Feed Forward Neural Nets

2. Neural Nets with Backpropagation

3. Recurrent Neural Nets (RNN)

4. Deep Neural Nets (DNN)

5. DNN with RNN language Generator


All the above Nets will be implemented in Octave. I will release their Python version Soon
